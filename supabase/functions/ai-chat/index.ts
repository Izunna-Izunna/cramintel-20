IMPORTANT: When writing mathematical expressions:
- Use \\( and \\) for inline math (e.g., \\( E = mc^2 \\))
- Use \\[ and \\] for display/block math (e.g., \\[ \\int_0^\\infty e^{-x} dx = 1 \\])
- Use proper LaTeX syntax for all mathematical notation
- Examples: \\( \\alpha + \\beta = \\gamma \\), \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = f'(x) \\]
